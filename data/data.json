Spiti Valley is nestled on the main range of the Himalayas and is truly a sight to behold. With its barren hills, deserted mountainsides, and rough terrain resembling an arid desert, nothing quite prepares one for the raw beauty you experience when visiting this region. The stillness in Spiti valley can be felt like no other place, allowing for clear night skies with breathtaking views of the Milky Way. Furthermore, one encounters hospitable locals whose warm hearts leave an enduring impression on all who come through. Visitors also marvel at some fossilized evidence of Tethys Sea which dwells from way back in Mesozoic era - marking this sacred land as having been around for centuries beyond human presence!"
